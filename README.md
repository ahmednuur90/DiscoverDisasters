# DiscoverDisasters

##Inspiration
Our inspiration comes from the recent wave of disasters due to climate change

##What it does
It lets you choose a location/country and it displays the most common disaster and how many happened in the records

##How we built it
We used Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS

##Challenges we ran into
Time constraints and merging the front-end and back-end of the project

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to efficiently parse through the Excel file to get the data we need

##What we learned
We need to do more planning

##What's next for DiscoverDisasters
lists of more disasters
